# PureGIS

> Create geospatial data with type safety

This project is currently in a pre-development stage. Expect it to be in the oven for the foreseeable future. Rapid prototyping and iteration of core types and design principles are to be expected. This project will require significant time to be suitable for basic testing, let alone production use. Look forward to an iterative approach that prioritizes quality, type safety, and scope above quantity and feature creep. If you see a white paper for PureGIS in the distant future, then it is a good sign that the project is getting somewhere.
